# Graph:
--------
1. Adjacency List representation for undirected graph  
AdjacencyList_graph.c  
AdjacencyList_graph.cpp  
  
There are representation of graph is given below  
|0|->[3]->[2]->[1]->NULL,  
|1|->[2]->[0]->NULL,  
|2|->[3]->[1]->[0]->NULL,  
|3|->[2]->[0]->NULL,  
  
2. Breadth First Search (BFS Algorithm)  
BFS_Graph.C  
  
3. Depth First Search (DFS Algorithm)  
Program: DFS_Graph.C  
  
4. Detect cycle in an undirected graph using DFS
